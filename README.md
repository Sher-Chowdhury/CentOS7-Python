### Overview


This vagrant project has a bunch of python sample code that you can experiment with.


Python comes with a standard library:

https://docs.python.org/3/library/

python follows 'batteries included' phylosophy. Like ansible. 


you can access the python repl (read-eval-print-loop) cli by running:

# python3.6
Python 3.6.4 (default, Oct  2 2018, 09:39:42)
[GCC 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-28)] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 2*5
10
>>> x = 5
>>> print(x)
5

python gives meaning to whitespace. you do indents for thinks like if-else statements, loops, functions, classes, etc.


by conventions:
 - indent using spaces
 - always indent by 4 spaces. 
For more info about these conventions, see:
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/?
Also see the zen of python:
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/
or just run:
>>> import this

'import' is a statement. for more about statements see:

https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html
