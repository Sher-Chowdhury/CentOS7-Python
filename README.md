Python comes with a standard library:

https://docs.python.org/3/library/

python follows 'batteries included' phylosophy. Like ansible. 


you can access the python repl (read-eval-print-loop) cli by running:

# python3.6
Python 3.6.4 (default, Oct  2 2018, 09:39:42)
[GCC 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-28)] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 2*5
10
>>> x = 5
>>> print(x)

python gives meaning to whitespace. you do indents for thinks like if-else statements, loops, functions, classes, etc.
